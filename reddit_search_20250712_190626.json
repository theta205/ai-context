    "selftext": "Title says it all. I have access to an oven. I don't have anyone to help me out with making the cake at the moment.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for your answers guys. I was looking for a recipe from scratch. Cos I already have most of the ingredients and only probably needed Vanilla Essence (which I just got for this). Actually I had a lot of flour lying around that I had to finish, and the other ingredients are usually always there with me, that's why I thought of making a cake. But I didn't know which recipe to begin with as it all seemed to complicated. That's why I thought of asking in the Reddit forums as previously it had been helpful to me with such queries.",

        "body": "This is my go to chocolate cake recipe that is super easy. Apologies if you need to convert the measurements- where I am we use metric. \n\nFirst preheat the oven to 180C. Grease (lather with oil or butter) a cake tin that is about 20cm round or square. If you want, out a little baking paper in the bottom to help the cake come out. \n\nMeasure 125g of butter, chop it into cubes and melt it in a saucepan until it is just melted (don’t boil it, go slowly). \n\nPut all the following into a bowl: 2 eggs (beat them a little), 100ml milk (any type), 1 tsp vanilla extract, 120g sugar (fine is better but any type is ok), 120g self raising flour, 30g cocoa powder, 1tsp baking powder. Add the butter too then mix well with a whisk, hand beaters or electric beaters (you can even use a blender). Mix until just combined, so it is like a batter.  \n\nPour the batter into the cake tin. Bake for 25-35 minutes. You may need to turn the cake tin gently once during cooking if you oven has an uneven way of cooking. Gently touch the top of the cake, it should bounce back, not push in. It will be really cooked if you can poke the centre with a skewer and it comes out clean, not coated in batter. \n\nWhen you are satisfied that is is cooked, let it cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn the cake out onto a wire rack. If you don’t have a wire rack, use a plate with some layers of paper towel on it.  You can eat it now or wait for it to cool completely if you want to ice it. \n\nThis recipe will also work with gluten free flour but I would add an extra egg.",

        "body": "Actual baker here. Obligatory on mobile so sorry if this formats weird. I saw a really good comment already so I won’t repeat what they already said, but I’ll go over some things.\n\n1) Pick a recipe before shopping and look in detail at those ingredients. Do not substitute, increase or decreased any of the ingredients, as this is your first time making it. *Even if the internet says you can*. Follow the recipe.\n\n2) Do not use cake flour unless it asks for cake flour. This is a common misconception that you can just substitute it for all purpose flour, but it isn’t always true. Cake flour affects the the texture, and while for some recipes it isn’t an issue, some recipes it alters the gluten development too much. Once again, follow the recipe.\n\n3) Do not “pack” or “eyeball” your ingredients. Packing is just when you put ingredients in your cup then cram them down so you can put more in. You can choose to weigh your ingredients or use the back of a knife to scrape the remaining dry ingredients off to create a flat top on your cup. I will be honest if I were you, I don’t think it’s necessary going the extra mile of weighing the ingredients for a single cake. They’re pretty beginner friendly and maybe that’s bad advice, but I’m gonna say it because “weigh the ingredients” can sound a bit intimidating when a cake should not be too scary:)\n\n4) What’s your fat source? If it’s butter we have some talking to do. Make sure it is SOFTENED so you can stick your finger in it. If it’s too cold and you need to panic make your cake, cut the stick into 9 pieces and microwave in 5 second intervals, turning them over as you go so it’s heated evenly. Microwaving is your last resort though. Cakes made with butter also typically tend to rise less.\n\n5) Don’t open the oven to much while baking. If a cold draft enters in the middle of baking, it can stop the rising process. Near the end, it’s ok. Test your cake with a toothpick in the middle. Poke it down in the middle and if it comes out clean, it’s good. \n\n6) Make the icing (or don’t, you do you.) Find a recipe online for BUTTERCREAM as this is your first time. Make sure you purchase the bricks of butter, not spreadable. \n\n7) Once again, soft butter please. Add the sugar one cup at a time and only add more once it’s either incorporated, or you need to add more liquid. Scrape your bowl frequently. \n\n8) Getting the texture. Add the milk one tablespoon at a time and mix for one minute before adding anymore. Near the end, add it one TEA spoon at a time. You want it thicker than peanut butter, but it should still hold its shape when your knife goes through it.\n\n9) If using food colouring, go for a pastel look, not red or royal blue since it’s your first time.\n\n10) Decorating. Chill your cake.  Cool your cake on the counter and put it in the fridge for at least a half hour (if longer than an hour, wrap it in cling wrap so it doesn’t dry out. You can even wrap it overnight and decorate the next day). This will decrease the amount of crumbs that come off when icing (see next point).\n\n11) The terrifying crumb coat. The crumb coat is the first layer of icing you put on. It picks up any crumbs stuck on the cake so it will look ATROCIOUS. You are going to cover the whole cake in a thin layers of icing to do this. Have a second bowl ready to put any remaining crumb coat icing into it because you don’t want to mix crumb icing with fresh clean icing! If for some reason you decided NOT to chill your cake, you will pick up WAY MORE CRUMBS!!! Chill your cake!\n\n12) Did you finish your crumb coat? Cool, put that sucker in the fridge for a good 15-30 minutes to harden up. It’s been 15 minutes and you can ice it how you’d like. I noticed you said you were unsure about piping bags, but you can still make fun borders on the top and bottom of your cake using candies, sprinkles, chocolate chips, cookie crumbs, and fruit. You can also use a ziplock bag as a faux-piping bag and cut the corner off to experiment with piping. Pipe some icing on a piece of parchment so you can easily scrape it off and back into your bowl to practice. Try dots and spirals, as writing might be difficult.\n\nGood luck!\n\nBasic American buttercream recipe since you made it all the way here (double batch since you always need more icing than you think):\n\n1 cup of butter\n\n6 cups of icing sugar/powder sugar (I’m in Canada, I know they call it different things in different parts of the world sorry)\n\n2 teaspoons of vanilla\n\n1/4 teaspoon of salt\n\n6-9 tablespoons of milk. I usually end up using 8 1/2, but I hear of people using way less milk than me and getting a texture they like so use your discretion",

        "body": "You will need a cake pan, as well as a large mixing bowl and something to mix with. I’m not in Europe so idk what your sizes are, but in America the most common cake recipes are for a 9” x 13” pan, which is also 1/4 sheet pan size. To tell if the cake is done, insert a toothpick, butter knife, or something else like that into the center. If the object comes out clean, the cake is done. If there is any visible batter or crumbs stuck to it, then it still needs more time. (Note that some recipes might advise you to take it out when it’s slightly underdone, so watch for that.)\n\nYou could make it the day before, cover it well with Saran Wrap or a lid (some cake pans have them), and then ice it the morning of. Making it the morning of is also fine but you’ll need to allow a couple of hours because you usually want it to be at least mostly cool before you ice it.",

        "body": "None of these are stupid questions! \n\nJust some brainstorming here - you could do cupcakes. They can be a bit easier and still fun and luxurious. \n\nOr, a strawberry shortcake. That leaves a lot of room for error. It just requires you make some kind of cake (and it can even be dense, almost like a cookie), a strawberry sauce, and whipped cream. It's meant to be messy and it is festive. \n\nYou could even make tiramisu with some bought ladyfingers. It's good for beginners and it's soooo delicious and fancy.\n\nCarrot cake is also a really easy cake, relatively speaking. \n\nBut for a more traditional birthday cake, I would make a white or chocolate single layer cake (as the other commenter said, 9x13 is standard). This is called a sheet cake. It's designed to be served from the pan and be frosted on top, not the sides.\n\nTwo layer cakes are fun - with frosting between layers, on the sides, and on top - but take quite a bit more finesse. If you really want to do two layers, then say the word if you want instructions.\n\nAnyway, for any cake you make, you'll need a large mixing bowl (a 5-7-litre size should do it) in which you will mix the cake batter. \n\nYou need an eggbeater or electric mixer or large fork or sturdy big whisk to mix the batter with.\n\nYou'll need two good oven mitts for handling the hot pan. \n\nIt would be nice to have a rubber spatula for scraping out your batter bowl and later, your frosting, so there's no waste.\n\nYou'll need a metal spatula or cake server or butter knife to cut and serve the cake. \n\nYou can use a simple rounded butter knife to spread the frosting.\n\nYou'll need foil or plastic wrap to cover the sheet cake with after it's all ready.\n\nTo decorate the cake...honestly, unless you're really gung-ho, I wouldn't do any fancy piping on my first try. Instead I'd get creative, like using chocolate shavings or colorful sprinkles or topping with strawberries or cherries or candy pieces or whatever. Simply having chocolate frosting on a white vanilla cake with birthday candles can look very festive.\n\nI don't have an active wheat-based recipe for cake (gluten free over here), but here are some general tips based on your circumstances:\n\nThe general technique for mixing cake is to mix the dry ingredients together thoroughly, mix the wet ingredients together, and then combine.\n\nIf any wet ingredients for the cake batter, such as butter or chocolate chips, are to be cooked or melted first, make sure they cool off to room temperature before you add them to the eggs; otherwise the eggs will cook upon mixing.\n\nYou can beat the cake batter heartily under these conditions: If the cake is regular fat, not \"lite\" or \"low fat,\" AND if you use cake flour rather than bread flour, then it can take a decent amount of mixing and beating without getting tough. \n\nIf you don't have cake flour, you can use bread flour or all-purpose flour. They are high in gluten, which is bad for most types of cake.  It can make them tough. But what you can do is substitute about 1/4 of the flour with corn starch to make it act more like cake flour. \n\nIf you're only using bread flour or all-purpose flour with no corn starch, and especially if there is not a lot of oil or fat in the cake, then be very, very careful to mix the batter only gently and lightly, just until the wet and dry ingredients combine. Similar to if you're making muffins.\n\nWait to make the frosting until after you empty the bowl of the batter. That way you can do this whole project with only one bowl, rather than buying a second one. Wash the bowl completely after scraping out the batter, and re-use the bowl to make the frosting. \n\nAlso don't make the frosting too far ahead even if you have two mixing bowls. Made too soon, and even if covered properly, it can start hardening too fast, making it less pretty and less smooth to spread. Which can be fixed (such as by beating the heck out of it again) but if the goal is to minimize bother on your first venture, then just wait until the cake is in the oven to start on the frosting.\n\nHave the frosting ingredients at room temperature before mixing.\n\nWhen you frost, make sure the cake has lost all heat and is truly room temperature or even cool. 2 reasons for this:\n\n1) Frosting a warm cake will result in the cake crumbling up on your spreading utensil and then into the frosting, and you'll have cake crumbs all over your frosting. \n\n2) Unless you are using a cooked icing that is heat tolerant like a true fudge frosting, do not - please swear to me you will not - try to frost this cake until it is 100% cool. Most easy, basic, traditional frostings use butter or shortening that's softened, but never melted. You don't want your frosting to ever melt. You would weep if you went to all the work to soften the butter, mix in the confectioner's sugar, add the flavorings, whip, whip, whip - all that - and then you frosted the cake when it's still a little warm and the frosting just melted all over the cake. (I have been there, and I did weep.)\n\nThat's only what you want if it's literally meant to be a melted-over-cake frosting. You can tell those types of frosting because they're light on the fat and runny in the first place. Donuts are an example of something that uses designed-to-be melted frosting/icing.\n\nThe cake can be made at any point beforehand. Keep it in the fridge if it's a day ahead. If it's farther ahead than one day, you can pop it in the freezer as soon as it's cooled and frosted. Then take it out about 8 hours before serving. \n\nHope these random tips help - ask if you have any questions!!",

That way you can work on finding the recipes you like for both the cake and the frosting without the work of putting a whole cake together. \n\nYou'll need a cake tester or tooth picks if you poke them in the center and it comes out clean, only crumbs, the cake is done. If it comes out wet at all, there is still cooking to do. \n\nYou can make the cakes and wrap them in cling film and keep them in the fridge after they are cooled. This will help keep them fresh untill you can ice it. Also, keep the finished cake in the fridge too. Take it out a little while before you plan to serve it so that it can reach room temp.
