However VA won't have the same viewing angles. \n\nBleed and reduced contrast are intrinsic weaknesses of IPS that will affect all monitors. \n\nIf you want a bright monitor, then you will have brighter blacks with IPS. \n\nIf you want the brightest monitors, these will use full array local dimming and you will have bloom on fine details. \n\nThe best IPS monitors will have Quantum Dot films which will help, but it's not going to be an OLED. \n\nThe Cooler Master Tempest GP27Q is one such model. You get hundreds of mini-LEDs for local dimming and HDR1000 with over 1,000 nits of brightness. It also has a quantum dot film. \n\nThe AOC AG274QZM is another option. You get mini-LED, 600 nits, quantum dots, and 240hz. \n\nThe ASUS ROG STRIX XG27AQMR is 300hz, HDR 600, and maintains high color accuracy. \n\nThe Alienware AW2723DF is 280 hz, mini-LED, 600 nits, but sacrifices some color accuracy.",
