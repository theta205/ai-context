I have a laptop 3060 6 GB and it sucks now. Keeps running out of VRAM.

I have 1440p monitor and would love to build a new PC.

My budget is more flexible if i can get more value. I was considering 5070 ti and maybe new 9600 XT from AMD as well. 16 GB VRAM seems like a must for long term value.

Can you guys suggest something?

Edit : By best, I meant value. I can be a bit flexible with budget, but not looking for 5090 lol

<comment>Best for 1440p? 5070 ti with rtx. 9070xt without.</comment>
<comment>The *best* GPU for 1440p is the 5090. The 9070XT and 5070Ti are both great though. The 5070Ti is worth about 15% more than the 9070XT in my opinion.</comment>
<comment>I have the 5070, 5070ti, 9070xt, and 5080. 9070XT is best bang for your buck. Is closer to 5080 performance than the 5070ti.</comment>
<comment>Look for RX 7800XT or RX 9070</comment>
<comment>5070 ti https://www.3dmark.com/sw/2279735 That's my results</comment>

<title>Do 1440p 144hz 1ms monitors exist?</title>

I am looking to upgrade BenQ XL2411Z 24" monitor (1080p, 144hz, 1ms). I have enjoyed using this monitor for gaming and had no problems, but I want to upgrade to 1440p now with the 3000 cards on the horizon. 

I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/rVd3LX2DCCQ?t=171) with the best 1440p gaming monitors but none of them are 1ms. (Even though they say 1ms when I look at the store pages).

Can someone explain? I just want a 1440p monitor with at least 144hz and 1ms.

Also does this mean that my current monitor is not true 1ms? If it isn't that's fine, I have been happy with it.

EDIT: My main reason for looking at 1ms is because of my current BenQ monitor and my most played games are CSGO / comp shooters. I just use my PC for gaming, no films etc.

<comment>No current monitor even comes close to 1ms with anywhere near decent overdrive no. As long as it has no ghosting and good clarity, response times arent as important as you think ​ Edit : Let me clarify, those numbers are usually gray to gray so unless you play on grayscale they are useless, they might also use an unusuable due to overshoot overdrive setting(gl850 for instance) just tto advertise 1ms. Furtheremore there are some issues on certification and lack of standards which i dont know enough about, making 1ms on the box extremely meaningless. So you should not shy away when you see 4ms or 5ms average on review sites, those are great numbers.</comment>
<comment>Pretty sure 1 ms monitors are just marketing lies. No IPS has anything close to that.</comment>
<comment>The 27GL850 gets damn close on the "Fast" overdrive mode. Close enough that you likely won't notice the difference.</comment>
<comment>The LG Ultragear ones are among as close as you'd get. 27GL850 or the 34GL950/34GL950F ultrawide, and are IPS too.</comment>
<comment>I’m pretty sure that if 1ms 1440p 144hz monitors were actually a thing, you absolutely wouldn’t be able to tell the difference</comment>

OLED is not an option for me.

has to be/have:

IPS

1440p

27"

NOT curved

bright

good colors

144hz+ (pref. 180hz+)




so far i've tried:
ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ1A


LG UltraGear 27GS85QX-B 


Acer Nitro XV2 XV272U


ASUS ROG Strix XG27AQMR


...ranging from 250-550€ they all had terrible colors or other issues

not looking for any budget 
 or "value" options

thx

<comment>LG 27GP850 Edit: Ignore my suggestion. There are better and newer and cheaper models mentioned.</comment>
<comment>The premium monitors go 4K. 27" 1440P non-OLED is not quite a premium assignment segment, so it becomes awkward and obscure. If you want great color and deep blacks, then OLED is king. If you want vibrant colors and dark blacks, then VA beats IPS here. However VA won't have the same viewing angles. Bleed and reduced contrast are intrinsic weaknesses of IPS that will affect all monitors. If you want a bright monitor, then you will have brighter blacks with IPS. If you want the brightest monitors, these will use full array local dimming and you will have bloom on fine details. The best IPS monitors will have Quantum Dot films which will help, but it's not going to be an OLED. The Cooler Master Tempest GP27Q is one such model. You get hundreds of mini-LEDs for local dimming and HDR1000 with over 1,000 nits of brightness. It also has a quantum dot film. The AOC AG274QZM is another option. You get mini-LED, 600 nits, quantum dots, and 240hz. The ASUS ROG STRIX XG27AQMR is 300hz, HDR 600, and maintains high color accuracy. The Alienware AW2723DF is 280 hz, mini-LED, 600 nits, but sacrifices some color accuracy.</comment>
<comment>The MSI MAG274QRF-QD should be top of your list: https://youtu.be/i3X3yFh0-gE It's premium as far as IPS goes, but has decent contrast (For an IPS), very wide colour gamut and decent response times Many monitors don't ship with great calibration out of the box, requires a full calibration to get them right</comment>
<comment>[These people](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/best/by-usage/gaming) know what they are doing, you can look at every single monitor aspect and color performance.</comment>
<comment>May i ask just out if interest why no oled?</comment>
