OLED is not an option for me.

has to be/have:

IPS

1440p

27"

NOT curved

bright

good colors

144hz+ (pref. 180hz+)




so far i've tried:
ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ1A


LG UltraGear 27GS85QX-B 


Acer Nitro XV2 XV272U


ASUS ROG Strix XG27AQMR


...ranging from 250-550â‚¬ they all had terrible colors or other issues

not looking for any budget 
 or "value" options

thx

<comment>The premium monitors go 4K. 27" 1440P non-OLED is not quite a premium assignment segment, so it becomes awkward and obscure. If you want great color and deep blacks, then OLED is king. If you want vibrant colors and dark blacks, then VA beats IPS here. However VA won't have the same viewing angles. Bleed and reduced contrast are intrinsic weaknesses of IPS that will affect all monitors. If you want a bright monitor, then you will have brighter blacks with IPS. If you want the brightest monitors, these will use full array local dimming and you will have bloom on fine details. The best IPS monitors will have Quantum Dot films which will help, but it's not going to be an OLED. The Cooler Master Tempest GP27Q is one such model. You get hundreds of mini-LEDs for local dimming and HDR1000 with over 1,000 nits of brightness. It also has a quantum dot film. The AOC AG274QZM is another option. You get mini-LED, 600 nits, quantum dots, and 240hz. The ASUS ROG STRIX XG27AQMR is 300hz, HDR 600, and maintains high color accuracy. The Alienware AW2723DF is 280 hz, mini-LED, 600 nits, but sacrifices some color accuracy.</comment>
<comment>The MSI MAG274QRF-QD should be top of your list: https://youtu.be/i3X3yFh0-gE It's premium as far as IPS goes, but has decent contrast (For an IPS), very wide colour gamut and decent response times Many monitors don't ship with great calibration out of the box, requires a full calibration to get them right</comment>
