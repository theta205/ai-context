code faster and even make learning
enjoyable we&apos;re exploring the top 10 AI
Tools in today&apos;s video that are not only
smart but also beginners friends these
tools will help you to level up or start
out and make Python Programming seem
like a breeze all set to equip coding as
your new superpower let&apos;s start now
number one GitHub
co-pilot imagine having a programmer
friend who is constantly willing to
propose the next line of code even
before you know you will need it in
essence GitHub co-pilot is a strong AI
driven tool that lets you type quicker
by offering intelligent
recommendations using GitHub co-pilot
will teach you less effort intensive
cleaner more efficient code writing
techniques it&apos;s like having a mentor
leading you over each stage and Prov
iding real time help that accelerates
your learning curve what if you find
yourself caught on a particularly
challenging problem next we will discuss
a tool that will enable you to unravel
even the most messy code equivalent to
carrying a genius debugger right at hand
keep tuned number two repetz Ghost Rider
all set to expand on your coding then
introduce repetz Ghost Rider this
artificial intelligence tool generates
whole functions and even entire programs
depend depending on your input therefore
guiding your coding efforts it&apos;s like
having a supercharged autocomplete
function with style and code context
awareness ghost rer will let you rapidly
develop code snippits and learn new
coding strategies only by interacting
with this artificial intelligence tool
it&apos;s a great approach to increase output
and acquire understanding of best
practices imagine now that you must view
your code in real time and observe how
it functions we will then explore a
program that converts your code into
Interactive visuals therefore enabling
you to grasp Its Behavior and identify
and detect problems before they become
crises let&apos;s keep moving number three
tab N tab 9 is your go-to tool if you
want one that elevates code completion
this AI powered autocomplete tool
provides context aware recommendations
that get better as you work and fits
quite nicely into your coding setup by
allowing AI to predict and complete code
Snippets tab 9 will help you to speed up
your work by lowering mistakes and
increasing ing your efficiency your
process will be more seamless and
understandable if an AI continuously
learns and adjusts to your coding style
but if you wish for a program that can
genuinely learn from your errors or how
to code better we will then look at a
tool that offers comments and advice to
assist you raising your coding
competency similarly to a personal code
coach don&apos;t miss this number four code
GPT want to write code and get answers
to your programming problems right away
code gvt is a great program that uses
GPT technology to help with coding
chores and offer explanations for
different programming ideas it&apos;s like
having a professional coder right at
your fingertips you&apos;ll learn how to
quickly make code Snippets and get full
answers for tricky coding questions with
code GPT it helps a lot with learning
and fixing problems which makes code
problems a lot less scary want to know
about tools that will not only help you
code but also make sure it is perfect
next we&apos;ll talk about a tool that helps
you keep up with high quality code
standards and does automatic code
reviews watch out number five sorcery
have you ever wished you had a code
reviewer who checks every detail sorcery
is like having your own personal expert
on code quality who looks over your code
and offers ways to make it better it
works with your IDE and gives you input
in real time to help you write better
code sorcery will teach you how to
improve your code by giving ideas that
you can use to make it easier to read
and work better this tool makes it easy
to come up with best practices and clean
up your code what if you want a tool
that shows you your code mistakes right
away and lets you learn from them now
we&apos;ll talk about a tool that gives you
immediate feedback and chances to learn
for every mistake you make in code do
not go anywhere number six pilent pilent
is like having a watchful eye on your
python code this strong tool checks your
code for mistakes make sure you follow
the rules for writing code and gives
ideas on how to make your code better if
you want to write clean usable python
code you have to use this you&apos;ll see how
pilent helps you find bugs follow best
practices and and make your code easier
to read it detailed reports and ideas
are very helpful for both new and
experienced coders who want to get
better but what if you need a tool that
does more than just look over your code
what if you need one that also helps you
write tests to make sure it works
perfectly next we&apos;ll show you a tool
that will make sure your code always
works perfectly like having an automatic
testing suite number seven kite kite is
like having a personal coding assistant
knowing your coding style as you type
this AI powered tool provides clever
code compliments and documentation
searches it helps you create code faster
and with less mistakes by analyzing your
coding patterns and offering ideas that
complement your particular style kite
will help you improve your coding
efficiency with quick access to
pertinent documentation kite can
recommend the next logical lines of code
for instance if you&apos;re working on a
difficult function therefore saving you
time spent looking for syntax or method
names it even offers demand
documentation so you won&apos;t have to leave
your Editor to hunt for facts however if
you see a tool that not only helps with
code completion but also fits very well
into your workflow with sophisticated
debugging features we will then present
a tool that not only simplifies coding
but also debugging and optimizing your
code continue watching number eight pie
charm pie charm makes your IDE a
Powerhouse for python development when
paired with artificial intelligence
plugins robust features of pie charm are
welln when augmented with AI plugins it
provides intelligent code completion
error detection and automated code
production the these plugins smooth down
and speed your development process by
offering real-time feedback and
sophisticated refactoring features pie
charm will help you use tools including
code navigation rapid fixes and context
aware suggestions to simplify your
coding work for example error detection
helps find possible problems before you
ever run your code AI driven code
completion can forecast the next actions
depending on the situation of your
project these elements taken together
make coding less prone to mistakes and
more effici efficient but you might want
a solution that efficiently manages your
development projects and dependencies
going Beyond code writing we will then
discuss a tool that specializes in
Project organization to guarantee
scalable and well- maintaining of your
software number nine codex codex is an
artificial intelligence model capable of
comprehending and creating code in
several programming languages including
python it is capable of converting
natural language explanations into
useful code Snippets it is the engine
underlying many contemporary coding
tools from creating code based on basic
descriptions to tackling difficult
coding challenges codex May assist with
a variety of projects using codex&apos;s
sophisticated features will teach you
how to create whole functions or even
applications with only a few words for
instance you can specify a particular
capability you desire and codex will
generate code fit for your needs it&apos;s
like having a really intelligent
co-coder that can concurrently help with
coding and brainstorming curious about a
tool that transforms coding practice
into a dynamic and interactive EXP
experience in addition to facilitating
code generation we will then explore a
tool that increases the enjoyment and
ease of learning coding don&apos;t skip this
