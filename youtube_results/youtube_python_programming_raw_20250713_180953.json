a\ntool that offers comments and advice to\nassist you raising your coding\ncompetency similarly to a personal code\ncoach don't miss this number four code\nGPT want to write code and get answers\nto your programming problems right away\ncode gvt is a great program that uses\nGPT technology to help with coding\nchores and offer explanations for\ndifferent programming ideas it's like\nhaving a professional coder right at\nyour fingertips you'll learn how to\nquickly make code Snippets and get full\nanswers for tricky coding questions with\ncode GPT it helps a lot with learning\nand fixing problems which makes code\nproblems a lot less scary want to know\nabout tools that will not only help you\ncode but also make sure it is perfect\nnext we'll talk about a tool that helps\nyou keep up with high quality code\nstandards and does automatic code\nreviews watch out number five sorcery\nhave you ever wished you had a code\nreviewer who checks every detail sorcery\nis like having your own personal expert\non code quality who looks over your code\nand offers ways to make it better it\nworks with your IDE and gives you input\nin real time to help you write better\ncode sorcery will teach you how to\nimprove your code by giving ideas that\nyou can use to make it easier to read\nand work better this tool makes it easy\nto come up with best practices and clean\nup your code what if you want a tool\nthat shows you your code mistakes right\naway and lets you learn from them now\nwe'll talk about a tool that gives you\nimmediate feedback and chances to learn\nfor every mistake you make in code do\nnot go anywhere number six pilent pilent\nis like having a watchful eye on your\npython code this strong tool checks your\ncode for mistakes make sure you follow\nthe rules for writing code and gives\nideas on how to make your code better if\nyou want to write clean usable python\ncode you have to use this you'll see how\npilent helps you find bugs follow best\npractices and and make your code easier\nto read it detailed reports and ideas\nare very helpful for both new and\nexperienced coders who want to get\nbetter but what if you need a tool that\ndoes more than just look over your code\nwhat if you need one that also helps you\nwrite tests to make sure it works\nperfectly next we'll show you a tool\nthat will make sure your code always\nworks perfectly like having an automatic\ntesting suite number seven kite kite is\nlike having a personal coding assistant\nknowing your coding style as you type\nthis AI powered tool provides clever\ncode compliments and documentation\nsearches it helps you create code faster\nand with less mistakes by analyzing your\ncoding patterns and offering ideas that\ncomplement your particular style kite\nwill help you improve your coding\nefficiency with quick access to\npertinent documentation kite can\nrecommend the next logical lines of code\nfor instance if you're working on a\ndifficult function therefore saving you\ntime spent looking for syntax or method\nnames it even offers demand\ndocumentation so you won't have to leave\nyour Editor to hunt for facts however if\nyou see a tool that not only helps
