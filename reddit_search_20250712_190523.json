    "selftext": "i see a lot of people asking for hitting tips for themselves or for their kids, so i thought i’d give my unwarranted advice (disclaimer: i am not a hitting coach nor am i an expert at hitting, i just want to try and help those that want it. these are things i use to help me hit better, and hopefully i can help those that want to get better).\n\n1. timing. in my opinion, timing is the most important key to hitting. you can have a B+ swing, but if you have good, consistent timing, then you’ll be more successful if you have an A+ swing but bad timing. a rule of thumb i’ve used is it’s always better to be early than late. neither are good when it’s extreme, but you’ll have more power and have better results if you’re a little early than if you’re a little late. for me, i always try and get my foot down when the pitcher’s front foot lands. this gives me ample time to see the pitch out of his hand, and make the decision to swing or not. your timing mechanism may be different than mine (say if you have a big leg kick or you don’t stride in your swing), but you should have something to gauge your timing when hitting. i’ve found the best drill to help this is to just see pitches. timing is an instinct, and i think that seeing live pitches, from a pitching machine or from live bp or live at bats, is the best way to help your timing.\n\n2. stay inside the ball. a lot of younger hitters i see in this sub get around the ball a little too much. this means that their arms extend too early and their swing basically wraps around the ball. keeping your hands inside the baseball and keeping the bat close to your body will greatly help your hitting.\n\n3. swing plane (i know some of you may have just rolled your eyes lol, but hear me out). disclaimer: this is more for high school or more advanced hitters, it may be a little advanced for young kids, so take what i say with a grain of salt. if you look at any major league or college hitter, they all swing slightly (key word: SLIGHTLY) upwards. this is because the pitch will be coming from a slightly downwards angle because he’s on a mound. swinging slightly upwards gives you the best chance of hitting line drives. swinging down doesn’t make any sense (“don’t chop at it, it’s not a sword” - Rob Schneider), and swinging level means your timing has to be PERFECT to hit it square. now, don’t swing too upwards, because that means you’re gonna drop your back shoulder and pop it up. pop ups = outs, and outs aren’t fun.\n\n4. swing with your hips and legs, not your arms. this relates back to number 2. your arms do not provide the power and speed of your swing; the hard rotation of your upper body, hips, and legs do. if you you can see in video two i turn my body FIRST, then my arms follow along for the ride. a good drill to do for this is to basically get in your stance, stride, then turn your body as fast as you can without engaging your arms (almost like a check swing). \n\n5. swing with intent. this will help all of these other tips fall in place. if you swing to do damage and attack the ball instead of just trying to make contact, you’ll have better timing, your body will turn hard, and you’ll stay inside the ball better.\n\n6. HAVE FUN. hitting is fun. do not get down in yourself because you may be struggling. enjoy the process of figuring it out and tinkering with your mechanics. if you do that, it is so rewarding to see your hard work pay off. don’t see it as “i need to figure out why my swings flawed” see it as “i get to improve on my craft and do what i enjoy”. my biggest mistake in baseball was not enjoying getting better until it was too late.\n\nif you have any questions, i’ll answer them to the best of my ability. please feel free to dm me if you have any as well. i hope i helped someone out, and i hope i didn’t just confuse you more lol.",

    "selftext": "11u AAA coach here looking for thoughts on what kind of approach other coaches teach to have at the plate.  \n\nOur approach has always been pretty simple.  Look for your pitch and hit it hard.  Pay attention to the ump's zone so you know what it is and adjust.  Protect with 2 strikes.  \n\nOver the last 6 games, we've been walked 43 times in 28 innings.  In those same games, we've walked 14 batters.  \n\nI'm wondering if we are teaching our kids to be too selective and hampering their development in the process.  I wouldn't think so, but man I just can't help but notice how much more patient we are at the plate than most teams we face.  And, that patience comes at the cost of taking hacks.  \n\nAt the same time, hitting isn't about who can hit the ball the most, but who can hit it hardest the most.  In practice, we'll focus on mechanics and hit ball hard using distance as the measuring stick.  I just can't help but wonder if we're doing a disservice to the kids teaching them to wait for 'their pitch' and letting them walk.\n\nAnd, yes, I'm aware that 6 games is a relatively random sample size.  But, it's the last 6 games.  Mid season in relatively competitive tournaments against other AAA/maj teams. And, prior to that there were some odd tournaments playing up against some very wild pitchers which makes the stats even more skewed.   ",

If they look like they are just standing there waiting for a walk, then you need to change something.  11U strike zone is pretty big usually, and if you are getting walked that much, you may just need to find better competition.",

        "body": "Oh I definitely agree.  There's a time and a place to work the count, like after the pitcher's walked a few guys.  But ages 9-12 is a great time for kids to learn to attack and mash.  If you are really into development encourage them to look to murder anything middle on 3-0 as well.\n\nA lotta dads sat around watching moneyball and think their kids need to learn how to draw walks.  I like you using the concepts you outlined above.  Our idea (at this age) was the goal of every at bat was to get a barreled ball.\n\nWhen you get to high school you may see one pitch per at bat that you can drive, so learn to take advantage of it when you see it.  You are 100% teaching the right approach.",

They should be loading with every pitch. Teach them to look for their pitch and crush it when they do. My goal for my 9U team is I don't care if they strike out as long as they swing hard at good pitches to hit. Not swinging over our heads or in the dirt.",
