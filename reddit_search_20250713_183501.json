Keeps running out of VRAM.\n\nI have 1440p monitor and would love to build a new PC.\n\nMy budget is more flexible if i can get more value. I was considering 5070 ti and maybe new 9600 XT from AMD as well. 16 GB VRAM seems like a must for long term value.\n\nCan you guys suggest something?\n\nEdit : By best, I meant value. I can be a bit flexible with budget, but not looking for 5090 lol",

(Even though they say 1ms when I look at the store pages).\n\nCan someone explain? I just want a 1440p monitor with at least 144hz and 1ms.\n\nAlso does this mean that my current monitor is not true 1ms? If it isn't that's fine, I have been happy with it.\n\nEDIT: My main reason for looking at 1ms is because of my current BenQ monitor and my most played games are CSGO / comp shooters. I just use my PC for gaming, no films etc.",

As long as it has no ghosting and good clarity, response times arent as important as you think\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Let me clarify, those numbers are usually gray to gray so unless you play on grayscale they are useless, they might also use an unusuable due to overshoot overdrive setting(gl850 for instance) just tto advertise 1ms. Furtheremore there are some issues on certification and lack of standards which i dont know enough about, making 1ms on the box extremely meaningless.  So you should not shy away when you see 4ms or 5ms average on review sites, those are great numbers.",

However VA won't have the same viewing angles. \n\nBleed and reduced contrast are intrinsic weaknesses of IPS that will affect all monitors. \n\nIf you want a bright monitor, then you will have brighter blacks with IPS. \n\nIf you want the brightest monitors, these will use full array local dimming and you will have bloom on fine details. \n\nThe best IPS monitors will have Quantum Dot films which will help, but it's not going to be an OLED. \n\nThe Cooler Master Tempest GP27Q is one such model. You get hundreds of mini-LEDs for local dimming and HDR1000 with over 1,000 nits of brightness. It also has a quantum dot film. \n\nThe AOC AG274QZM is another option. You get mini-LED, 600 nits, quantum dots, and 240hz. \n\nThe ASUS ROG STRIX XG27AQMR is 300hz, HDR 600, and maintains high color accuracy. \n\nThe Alienware AW2723DF is 280 hz, mini-LED, 600 nits, but sacrifices some color accuracy.",
